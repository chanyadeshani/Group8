What was your motivation? 

       To learn how to analyse data with python codes and libraries  

Why did you build this project? 

       To predict the survival rate of passengers of the titanic 

What problem does it solve? 

        By using some regression and classification models we were able to predict the survival rate with a 94% success rate 

What did you learn? 

       We learnt that certain factors influenced the survival of the passengers in the titanic like family size, gender, age, class and fare 

What makes your project stand out? 

     We built several machine models and we picked the one with best prediction rate of 94%. We used the same classifier models on different independent variables and compared their accuracies, to understand what variables influenced the survival rate.  

 

 

# Python Data Manipulation on a Titanic dataset  

 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

 

The aim of this project was to show: 

>What factors determined passengers survival in the titanic  

>Factors that reduced the chances of survival of certain passengers 

 

Importing some certain libraries, python codes were used to answer the questions above and to visually illustrate these same answers in a clear manner.

Libraries imported were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Titanic dataset picked by Team 8: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 

 The Titanic dataset was split into test and train sets so that the latter dataset can be used to train the machine learning model. The test set is used to test the model to check the accuracy of the predictions. 

The first step in cleaning this dataset was dropping columns which were not so important. In the ‘Embarked’ column, missing values were replaced with the mode

>Classification techniques employed to create predictive models of the titanic dataset in the barplot showing survived versus fatalities. Also a barplot showing how the sexes fared, which sex had the higher survival rate.
