# Python Data Manipulation on a Titanic dataset  

 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 







What was our motivation? 

       To learn how to analyse data with python codes and libraries  

Why did we build this project? 

       To predict the survival rate of passengers of the titanic 

What problem did we solve? 

        By using some regression and classification models we were able to predict the survival rate with a 94% success rate 

What did we learn? 

       We learnt that certain factors influenced the survival of the passengers in the titanic like family size, gender, age, class and fare 

What makes our project stand out? 

     We built several machine models and we picked the one with best prediction rate of 94%. We used the same classifier models on different independent variables and compared their accuracies, to understand what variables influenced the survival rate.  

 

The aim of this assessment was to answer with well detailed python codes: 

>What factors determined passengers survival in the titanic ?

>Factors that reduced the chances of survival of certain passengers ?

 

Importing some libraries, python codes were used to answer the questions above and to visually illustrate these same answers in a clear manner.

Variables in the Titanic Dataset
Pclass: Passenger classes based on fares paid and a possible refelction of their economic standings
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

Age of each passenger of the Titanic

Sibsp =dataset defines family relations : Siblings/Spouse
Sibling = Sister, Brother, Step-sister, Stepbrother
Spouse = Husband and Wife


Parch : defines family relations
Parent = Mother and Father
Child = Daughter, Son, Step-daughter and Step-son

Libraries imported were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Titanic dataset picked by Team 8: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 

The Titanic dataset was split into test and train sets so that the latter dataset can be used to train the machine learning model. The test set is used to test the model to check the accuracy of the predictions. 

The first step in cleaning this dataset was dropping columns which were not so important to our analysis. In the ‘Embarked’ column, missing values were replaced with the mode values using the approriate python codes.

>Data visualization of answers to the questions listed in the Project Description, using Seaborn library and Matplotlib library and other libraries can be seen  

>Classification techniques employed to create predictive models of the titanic dataset in the barplot showing survived versus fatalities. Also a barplot showing how the sexes fared, which sex had the higher survival rate.
